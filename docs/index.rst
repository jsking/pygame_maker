PyGameMaker Project
===================

The overall goal for pygame_maker: create computer games without needing a
programming textbook.  As in ENIGMA, and the Game Maker(r) game engine it
emulates, games can be constructed in a graphical environment.  Using Python as
the base for the engine gives the user the freedom to customize the game engine
itself, beyond just installing plugins.  Moreover, familiarity with the logic
required to construct a game may aid in learning programming languages later on,
and the Python language itself provides a natural starting point.
